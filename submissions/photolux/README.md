I made a simple audio visualizer that takes input from a mono audio jack and flashes colors. It's pretty cool!

Design was honestly really hard. Originally I wanted to do baremetal but then i realized how difficult that would be to route and debug. So eventually I switched to my current design and finished it in like 5 hours. I then proceeded to forget about this for 3 weeks before submitting it properly.
